# iOSSimpleChat

This app is a simple demo for showing the power of developing iOS applications using [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/). These links have more information about getting started with PubNub on iOS in [Objective-C](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/ios-objective-c/ and [Swift](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/swift/).

## Features
* Simple chat

## Requirements

* This app will only work on iOS 10+ devices (PubNub push works on all iOS devices that are supported by Apple APNS).
* macOS 10.12+
* Xcode 8.3+
* Cocoapods 1.2+
* PubNub iOS SDK 4.5+

## Using this app with your account
If you want to use this app to test push with your own PubNub account, then you need to replace the publish and subscribe keys. 

Make sure to use the bundle identifier already in the app or change it to one you are provisioning. You can find the bundle ID of the app in Xcode:
